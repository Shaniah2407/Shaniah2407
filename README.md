### Welcome to my world. A world where bug are features and semicolons are the secret sauce to infinity loops! 

### Who Am I?
Hey there! I'm Shaniah, your friendly neighborhood here to experience the world of GitHub. Whether you're here for some coding inspiration or just a good laugh, I'm here for the same😁.

### What Can You Expect?
- *Smart Insights:* Dive into my code repositories for some magic.✨
- *Humor Galore:* Expect plenty of puns, jokes, and witty comments sprinkled throughout(Beware, I never said I was funny).😁

### Let's Connect!
